        <h3>Since Maine has had several weeks of cold weather (often single digits during the night), the local rivers are<br> 
            mostly frozen, therefore I have decided to create a virtual river (actually more of a virtual flume) using the<br>
            3D computational fluid dynamics modeling (CFD) software package DualSPHysics (https://dual.sphysics.org/), which<br>
            is based on a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. <br>
            
        <h3>Site Map: The virtual river existis within my desktop computer in my home office at 199 Concord Street, Portland, Maine.</h3>

        <h3>Model Virtual Layout: The virtual river reach (or flume) is 14-m long and 3.6-m at its widest, there are 2 drops of 0.12-m at<br>
            the tranissions in width.  The bed slope in between the drops is 0.01 m/m. the typical depth of flow is between 0.3- and 0.4-m,<br>
            except for where the flow goes super critical at the upstream drop.  The SPH fluid particle size is 0.02-m and the model<br>
            consits of just over 2 million particles.  </h3>
