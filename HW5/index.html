        <h1>Part 1 - Background</h1>
        <h3>Since Maine has had several weeks of cold weather (often single digits during the night), the local rivers are<br> 
            mostly frozen, therefore I have decided to create a virtual river (actually more of a virtual flume) using the<br>
            3D computational fluid dynamics modeling (CFD) software package DualSPHysics (https://dual.sphysics.org/), which<br>
            is based on a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. <br>
            
        <h3>Site Map: The virtual river existis within my desktop computer in my home office at 199 Concord Street, Portland, Maine.</h3>
