            The layout of the sediment flume table (SFT) is shown in Figure 1.  Inlet A appeared to provide a steady low flow,<br>
             while Inlet B supplied the flood flows.  </p>

                Several features, left over from previous sediment flume runs, were evident, including diagonal bars and oxbow cut off. </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 2px;">
            Main Video: Time 00:10 to 00:18 [mm:ss] </h3>
        
            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 2px;">
                See Figure 2 for referenced locations.<br>
                As flow went from zero to a low (non-flood) flow rate, much of the flow from the SFT Inlet-A flowed into the first diagnoal bar channel <br>
                (Side Channel B).  At time=10s, it appears that Side Channel B's connection to Main Channel C was slighly elevated relative to the bed <br>
                elevation of Main Channel C.  At time=15s, the downstrean end of Side Channel B quickly down cut (bed erosion) to match the main channel's<br>
                bed elevation, resulting in the steepening of the side channel's bed slope.  As predicted by Lane's relationship, for a given flow rate and<br>
                sediment size, in increase in bed slope (S) results in an increase in the sediment transport rate.  This was observed by the rapid bank erosion <br>
                of the river-right bank of Side Channel B. </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 2px;">
                Sediment transport was observed throughout Main Channel C, the transport of the black sand (0.7mm) showed up nicely in the video. The red<br>
                sand (0.4mm), of smaller caliber than the black sand, when present, would also have been transported.  At time=11s, there was active flow <br>
                at point D, moving from right to left, over the next 10 seconds, enough white (1.0mm) and yellow (1.4mm) sand grains settled in the channel <br>
                (deposition) to divert the flow towards the bottom-left of the picture.  Downstream of this point, it appears that much of the flow seeped into th sand <br>
                matrix resluting stranding of the sand grains atop the matrix (a type of deposition). <br>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 2px;">
                See Figure 3 for an example of sorted sediments.<br>
                At time=25s, the sand matrix at top of the flume (viewers top) was in the form of a ridge with an exposed face of white and black sands. From <br>
                time=28s to time=42s, a small flood moved along the top edge of the SFT, as it did so, it washed the ridge from the edge of the flume.  As the <br>
                flow and sediments moved away from the top edge, grain size sorting occured as the largest fraction (yellow sand) was deposited on top of the sand  <br>
                matrix. </p><br>

            P.3.2 & 3.3: &nbsp;&nbsp;Meandering and Braiding </h3>   

            <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 2px;">
                The number of bars in a river cross-section is often related to the channel planform type, with "alternate bars" and "meandering" channels having a <br>
                single bar per cross-section, while "braided" rivers have multiple bars per cross-section.  The SFT often had two active channels, with one being <br>
                more dominate than the other.  It appears that for flow rates in the range of low flows to small floods, the SFT was operating in the meandering to <br>
                braiding transitional zone.  The sandy, weak stream banks (to large for cohesive forces, not large enough for gravity to provide significant resisting <br>
                forces and no roots) and the sand matrix high porosity add to the complexity and rapid rate of change of the SFT planforms. </p><br>

                The process/observation of a channel avulsion was described above (see P.2.1 -2.4 second paragraph).  A chute cutoff was from time=1:10 to time=1:14, <br>
                see Figure 5 (below). </p><br>

                Several years ago I designed and help direct the construction of three Engineered Log Jams on the Narraguagus River in Maine.  There were multiple <br>
                project objectives, including narrowing the river to help re-mobilize a heavily armoured river bed.  </p><br>
